# TED WEBSITE CLONE 🖥️

## 🎯 Description
Welcome to the **TED WEBSITE Clone** project. This project is a replica of the official [ICC website](https://www.ted.com/), created as part of our participation in the MCT(Module Clearance Test). Our goal was to replicate the website as closely as possible, using only **HTML**, **Tailwindcss** and **CSS**. 

 We aimed to showcase our web development skills by accurately cloning the structure, design, and key features of the TED website.

This project was assigned by Geekster as a Project to me.
